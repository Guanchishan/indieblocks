Use blocks, and, optionally, "short-form" post types to easily "IndieWebify" your WordPress site.

== Description ==
IndieBlocks currently registers a single block, "Context," which takes a URL and "type," and outputs correctly microformatted HTML. More blocks are on the way.

In combination with a microformats-compatible theme, these help ensure Microformats clients are able to determine a post's type.

It also comes with "short-form" (Note and Like) custom post types, and a (somewhat experimental) option to add microformats to (all!) *block-based* themes.

== Installation ==
Upload this plugin's ZIP file via the Plugins > Add New > "Upload Plugin" button.

After activation, head over to *Settings > IndieBlocks*, and enable or disable its different features.
