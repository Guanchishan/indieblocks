# IndieBlocks
Use blocks, and, optionally, "short-form" post types to easily "IndieWebify" your WordPress site.

If you're running a "block theme," this plugin will attempt to add "microformats2" to it. (If your theme already supports microformats2, just leave this part disabled.)

Optionally, enable webmentions for posts, notes, and likes (and any other post types of your choosing). This, in combination with the aforementioned microformats2 and this plugin's "Context" block, will enable richer cross-site conversations. (If you're perfectly happy with your existing Webmention setup, here, too, you can simply leave this setting disabled.)
